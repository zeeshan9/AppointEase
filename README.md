# ðŸ“… CalendarApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.11.

## Overview

The **Calendar App** is a simple, interactive application that allows users to manage their appointments efficiently. It features an intuitive interface for adding, deleting, and moving appointments using Angular Material and Angular CDK for drag-and-drop functionality. The app also includes a custom "Page Not Found" component for handling invalid routes gracefully.

## Features

- **Add Appointment:** Users can add new appointments by clicking the "Add" button on the toolbar. This opens a form where they can enter the title, date, and time for the appointment.
- **Delete Appointment:** Each appointment has a delete button that allows users to remove the appointment from the calendar.
- **Move Appointment:** Appointments can be moved to a different date using drag-and-drop functionality provided by Angular CDK.
- **View Appointments:** Appointments are displayed on the calendar grid, and users can see the details of each appointment, including the title and time.
- **Page Not Found:** The app includes a "Page Not Found" component that provides a user-friendly message when users navigate to an invalid route. This component includes a link to redirect users back to the homepage.
